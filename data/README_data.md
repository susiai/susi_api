# data folder

This folder is here to provide a storage space for the data/file API functions.
Clients may load data from here and also may store data her.
Storage requires the susi_api API key. There are two sub-paths here:
- share: files that are supposed to be shared should go in here. No API key required to read files from here.
- protected: files can be accessed here only with a susi_api API key
